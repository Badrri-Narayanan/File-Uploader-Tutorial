# File-Uploader-Tutorial

## Brief Intro

How does file uploading works in web development? Should I initially save the file in server file system before I process it? How do I read the contents of the file?

These are the questions I had when I started exploring how file uploading works in modern web frameworks. I started this project to familarize myself with the same.

## Web Frameworks used

1. Node JS - Express JS
2. Java Springboot
3. Golang - Gin

and hope more to come...
